Submitted as compulsory Dissertation and accepted by University of Calcutta in 1993.<\/p><p>Findings : The main aetiology of chronic pancreatitis in eastern part of India is 'Malnutrition', contrary to the popular causes in the western world of alcohol excess and gall stone disease. Common age group was 25-45 years with equal male and female ratio. Histology of the pancreas showed gross fibrous deformity of both minor and major pancreatic ductal system giving rise to 'Chain of lakes' appearance on ERCP. Interesting findings were poor control of pain with analgesics, ultimately requiring surgical intervention (Puestow's pancreatico jejunostomy), with good long term result. <\/p><p> <\/p><p>Publications<\/p><p>\u2022 \"Prediction of cardiac risk in abdominal aortic surgery: comparison of a revised Goldman cardiac risk index and MUGA scan\".

Submitted as compulsory Dissertation and accepted by University of Calcutta in 1993.<\/p><p>Findings : The main aetiology of chronic pancreatitis in eastern part of India is 'Malnutrition', contrary to the popular causes in the western world of alcohol excess and gall stone disease. Common age group was 25-45 years with equal male and female ratio. Histology of the pancreas showed gross fibrous deformity of both minor and major pancreatic ductal system giving rise to 'Chain of lakes' appearance on ERCP. Interesting findings were poor control of pain with analgesics, ultimately requiring surgical intervention (Puestow's pancreatico jejunostomy), with good long term result. <\/p><p> <\/p><p>Publications<\/p><p>\u2022 \"Prediction of cardiac risk in abdominal aortic surgery: comparison of a revised Goldman cardiac risk index and MUGA scan\".
